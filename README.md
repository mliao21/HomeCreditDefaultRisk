# Home Credit Default Risk using Traditional Machine Learning

The most important questions in the banking and money lending industry are: How risky is the borrower and would they be able to repay the loan? And, should we lend them money? Knowing the answers to these questions, financial institutions can determine if they will be able to gain interest and get back their investment or will the borrower default and they will lose on their investment. To answer these questions, lenders would often examine borrowers credit history, however for new clients without history it is difficult to determine credit risk. In this [project](./final-project/), we trained and compared several traditional machine learning classifier models that utilize multiple features non-related to credit history to help determine the probability of a borrower not defaulting on investment. The training and test dataset “puzzle” was provided by Dr. Roberto Souza for the in-class example. Four different models were initially used to make predictions on the probabilities of defaulting. However, due to the imbalance nature of the database, four additional models were used in order to handle the imbalance nature of the data. The results of both sets of models were compared in terms of their recall/sensitivity and F1-score metric. The result of analysis showed that EasyEnsembleClassifier has the best F1 score of 68.1%.
